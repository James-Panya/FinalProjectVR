# Final Project VR
### James Panya

## Project Description
For this project, I would like to develop an obstacle course reminicent of 2010s America Ninja Warrior courses. Within the virtual reality project I would like to implement as much of the obstacle course as I can. For example, I'd like to recreate the four angled floating steps at the beginning, the grapple obstacles in the middle, and the climbing section at the end of the course. Not only will I implement these obstacle interactions, I want to be able to time and set scores for all of the participants and maybe have some sort of reward at the end of the class.

## Feature Breakdown
1. Recreating Monkey Tag Movement or Implementing Teleporting Again
   - Difficulty: Hard or Easy - I would like to implement some sort of movement similar to Monkey Tag, but if I'm unable to figure how to recreate it, I'll just create a teleport obstable in place.
2. Climbable Interactions
   - Difficulty: Hard - I was able to create a grab interactable that just picks up objects. Aside from that, I don't know how I'd implement a climbing interaction that pulls the character's camera as they move their arm.
   - Difficulty: Easy - Whenever a player hovers over a climbable object or if a player climbs, a haptic feedback to give them some signal. I've already done this with my Interactions Project.
3. UI Menu
   - Difficulty: Easy - Allow the user to switch between the scenes and restart the application within the menu window.
4. In-Game Button and maybe Leaderboard
   - Difficulty: Medium - Implementing the button will be easy, but sometimes the button wont recognize the hands I've created sometimes which wont be good to get the player's time. I need to also figure out how to Implement a start and stop timer.
   - Difficulty: Hard - Storing the player's time into a leaderboard will most likely require a database, unless I'm going to run the entire thing without restarting the entire thing.\
5. Particle Effects and SFX
   - Difficulty: Easy - Most likely a trigger and spawns in particles or confetti. SFX is very easy.

## Milestones
1. 11/16 - Implement grabbing interaction to pull camera towards more grabbable objects.
2. 11/23 - Try to recreate Monkey Tag movement.
3. 11/27 - UI Menu for scene swapping and restarting scene.
4. 11/30 - Fix the in-game button collision, implement timer at start and end of course, particle effects, and SFX.
5. 12/7 - Create the obstacle courses in all three scenes and then one big main obstacle course in one scene.
6. 12/11 - Maybe implement leaderboard. Double-check and should be done by this time.

## Inspiration
- Main inspiration for this obstacle course is America Ninja Warrior. I used to watch this a lot when I was a kid, so being able to create something similar to it would be very surreal.

- Second inspiration for the obstacle course is the VR Game called Monkey Tag. I haven't seen much games in VR, but Monkey Tag was one of the first movement games in VR that has really good movement in VR.

- Third inspiration for the obstacle course is a parkour game, that I have a lot of nostalgia for, called Mirror's Edge. I believe it was one of the best hidden gems for games due to it's aesthetics and game design.
